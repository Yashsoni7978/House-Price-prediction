This is a machine learning project by **Yash Soni**, a passionate data science enthusiast currently pursuing MCA with a specialization in Data Science & Analysis. This project focuses on predicting house prices using real-world housing data, combining statistical techniques and ML models to estimate accurate prices based on property features.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information about 21,000+ residential properties, including:
- Bedrooms & bathrooms
- Living area & lot size
- Floors, year built, renovation status
- Location coordinates (latitude & longitude)
- Neighborhood features such as view, condition, and grade

These attributes play a vital role in determining the price of each house.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to **build a regression-based predictive model** capable of estimating house prices. The model will help simulate real-world scenarios where buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals seek accurate property valuations.

## 🔍 Project Flow

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns, handled types, and normalized features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered patterns and correlations using heatmaps, bar plots, and distribution graphs.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived new variables like age and renovation status.
- **Model Training**: Implemented and compared:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
- **Evaluation**: Compared models using R² score and error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE).

## 💡 Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Pipeline, Regression models)
- Folium (for location mapping)

## 💼 Why This Project?

As an aspiring data analyst and data scientist, I created this project to:
- Apply core ML concepts to a real-world dataset
- Practice model evaluation and visualization techniques
- Demonstrate practical skills in regression modeling and EDA
- Strengthen my portfolio for future career opportunities

## 🚀 Impact

With accurate prediction capabilities:
- **Buyers** can make informed purchase decisions
- **Sellers** can set competitive asking prices
- **Agents** can provide better guidance
- **Investors** can identify high-potential areas for investment

This project also provides a deeper understanding of the key drivers behind house prices — location, space, condition, and more.
